Have you ever been annoyed to discover that your favorite e-commerce store has delivered your package to someone you don't know? I have, and I believe I'm not the only one, as I recently discovered a new Mercado Livre feature that solves this problem.

I recently bought a relatively expensive item for my office on Mercado Livre and was surprised by an email with a "secret word". The email explained that the courier was only authorized to deliver my package to someone who knew that word, a kind of password. Even the delivery man didn't know the password, meaning that if I didn't tell anyone the word, only I would be able to receive the package. That's great.

I liked this feature so much that I decided to develop a simplified version of it using Python, Django and Django REST Framework.
